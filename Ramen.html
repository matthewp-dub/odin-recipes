    <p>Making ramen is extremely hard and definitely not worth the effort. 
    If you want it to actually be good, you need to boil bones for like 2 days straight
    and then smoke pork shoulder to make chashu or some shit like that. Regardless,
    I've chosen to add this recipe becuase I went with a Japanese theme for the recipe
    project.

    <p>For the ingredients, you basically just need broth, noodles, and chashu.
    Any other toppings are entirely optional and can basically be thrown on top as desired.
    To actually make the ramen, heat the broth in a pot, and then pour it into a bowl.
    Use the same pot to boil the noodles, and then drain them once they are fully cooked.
    Put the noodles directly into the broth, and then place the chashu on top along with 
    Any other toppings.
